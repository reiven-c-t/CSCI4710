What sounds like a joke is a very real phenomenon that appears to have originated in the late 1980s and early 1990s as a backlash to the then-emerging presence of LGBT pride parades and festivals. Perhaps someone can laugh at it, but Straight Pride really means anti-LGBT. This so-called joke is actually rooted in very real hatred and fear. Students at the University of Massachusetts held a straight pride rally in 1990, waving homophobic signs and American flags. The term ""straight pride"" was just a new code phrase for anti-gay. ''I'm against homosexuality because I think it is perverse. It goes against God's law,'' the Times quoted rally leader Theordore Maravelias as saying. ''I don't want my tax money subsidizing a gay week.'' ""Straight pride"" was the phrase that united anti-LGBT students at a Tennessee high school this January, where students wore signs bearing the slogan in order to voice opposition to a gay-straight alliance (GSA) club that one parent compared to ISIS. Students also defaced GSA flyers with slurs like ""f**gots"" and ""no gays allowed.""",https://www.facebook.com/lgbtun/posts/1037357503007272,GMT-0400

But, rather than dance around the issue, she calls them out on their un-Christian attitudes and behaviors. Exactly God is about love not hate if we could all get along and accept each other for who we are then wow think how beautiful this world would be...

But there‚Äôs also a wonderful opportunity for a more open, honest relationship between family members. A recent study of families of gay and lesbian youth showed that parents who accepted their child as LGBTQ get to the point where they believe that the experience of having a gay child actually made them a better person--more open minded and sensitive to the needs of others, particularly those in other minority groups. Some even grew to be proud of their children's sexual orientation. Yet others found that their relationships with their children grew to be closer, stronger, and more honest than ever before. And of course this acceptance works both ways! Parents who accept and advocate for their non-heterosexual kids may be protecting them from depression and ill heath as adults. Isn‚Äôt it is the best thing a parent could do! After all, family is about hearts, not parts. I wish more parents would be warm and accepting towards their LGBTQ children! #LGBT #family #acceptance #comingout #LGBTyouth",https://www.facebook.com/lgbtun/posts/890932347649789,GMT-0400

During the Iowa State Fair last month Page confronted Cruz and asked him why he wouldn't stand up against discrimination toward LGBTQ individuals. ""Americans shouldn't be forced to do things that were against their religious beliefs,"" he responded. Page said that the GOP was ignoring public support in its own party for same-sex marriage. The spring polls of 2015 showed that a high percentage of Americans... except some of politicians... expressed support for gay marriage. ""At the same time I‚Äôve seen multiple videos and read multiple quotes of Ted Cruz discussing gay issues, as well as Mike Huckabee, and it goes exactly as you‚Äôd expect. They don‚Äôt answer the question,"" Page told to The Daily Beast. While a majority of Democrats and independents supported same-sex marriage in a May Gallup poll, just 37 percent of Republicans in the Gallup poll were inclined to support it. Hmmm, seems like the party of tolerance may only be tolerant when a person agrees with their personal views about things. Most of them are H-O-M-O-P-H-O-B-I-C. LGBT are Republicans' favorite whipping dogs. So Cruz, Huck and their clique obsessed with using big whips on LGBT and women.

Tony Perkins claims ‚Äòattack‚Äô on religious freedom worse than terrorism KKK-affiliated hate group leader Tony Perkins is at it again. This time he‚Äôs trying to scare his followers into believing the make-believe ‚Äúthreat‚Äù to religious freedom is ‚Äújust as dangerous‚Äù as ISIS according to Right Wing Watch. Perkins has beat his chest and pulled his hair out in clumps for years over ‚Äúradical Islamic terrorists,‚Äù so he must have a good reason for declaring his newfound obsession even worse, right? Sadly, all he has to back up his charges are several debunked claims about military chaplains and soldiers. Yeah look at all those laws being passed stopping religious people from getting married or buying a cake or using the bathroom! This bullshit has gotten so out of hand ! They whine that their rights are being taken away yet they are doing the same thing! Religion is not supposed to be that way! What we object to is your blatant attack on others rights! Religious freedom does not give you the right to persecute others for how they live THEIR lives!

Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis will have to choose whether to issue marriage licenses, defying her Christian conviction, or continue to refuse them, defying a federal judge who could pummel her with fines or order that she be hauled off to jail. For Ms. Davis to enact her own personal policy is completely unacceptable. She is on her fourth marriage, a sinner according to her Bible, yet she‚Äôs screaming about religious convictions. What a hypocrite! And she doesn't even perform the ceremony, only issue a license. What her religious convictions has to do with it?? It's not up to her to make policy, it's her role only to enact it! Funny how all these ""Christians"" are preaching and practicing all this hate, eh?

I replied with another question: ‚ÄòTell me: when God looks at a gay person, does he endorse the existence of this person with love, or reject and condemn this person?‚Äô We must always consider the person. Here we enter into the mystery of the human being.‚Äù Pope Francis has made a number of moves to make the Catholic Church more open and welcoming toward lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. He has been working to make the church more inclusive as a whole, to give this rigid religious institution chance of atonement.

However, this is a reality many LGBTQ kids still face growing up. Happily, this story has a happy ending! Jason, 27 split with his parents right after he came out to his mother. He described whole thing on Reddit: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 27 and I left the house as soon as I turned 18 (also right after coming out). She didn‚Äôt disown me, but made a lot of homophobic remarks about me ‚Äújoining the fags‚Äù and denying her grandchildren. I have a younger brother who‚Äôs 14 who lives with my parents. My mom snooped through his phone and apparently found a few texts to his friend confessing that he was gay. She forced him into confessing it to her and he confirmed it. Ever since then she kept accusing me of knowing the whole time and somehow making him gay.‚Äù Needless to say, Jason was more than concerned with what lay ahead for his little bro, who was just starting high school. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs very shy, sensitive kid. My mom runs her homophobic mouth will be too much for him. He don‚Äôt need that sh..t.‚Äù Jason knew what he had to do. ‚ÄúI told my mother he was going to stay with me. She wanted to argue at first, but held back agreed to sign it saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs probably better for me that you two will be gone anyway‚Äù. I‚Äôm getting forms from the lawyer about making me his legal guardian.‚Äù Can you believe this ‚Äúmother‚Äôs‚Äù bitchy attitude even when her family on the verge of collapse? Having at least 3 kids and driving two off because they didn‚Äôt turn out how you wanted is utterly disgusting. I‚Äôm sure Karma will get mom real good for being such an awful bitch of a mother. Thankfully, the older brother is nothing like either parent. Jason cares of his younger brother and it seems he‚Äôs well off too which is another good thing.
