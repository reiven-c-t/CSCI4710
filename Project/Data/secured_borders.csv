Yet, our deepest gratitude and unparalleled respect for the men and women who keep us safe often fails at repaying them in the ways they need it most when they return. And the source of this failure is unfair, unacceptable treatment our veterans are receive by the Government. Politicians shamelessly exploit troops as cannon fodder, only to abandon them afterwards, leaving hundreds of thousands injured, and wounded, traumatized veterans to struggle for survival. Many vets end up homeless. Shockingly, it is estimated that 1/3 of adult homeless men and nearly 1/4 of all homeless adults have served in the armed forces. Despite Obama’s so many times repeated promise to end veteran homelessness by the end of 2016, the number of homeless veterans in America has declined only by 11% during 2010-2015. On 2016, VA reports state that there are more than 50,000 homeless vets in the US. It seems that Congress and POTUS administration just discarded vets like trash. Veterans’ budget was cut by $2.6 bln in favor of Muslim refugees. Obama has upped the number of refugees bound for the U.S. to 110,000 in fiscal 2017, which began Oct. 1. For some reason, American veterans are much less important for Barack Hussein Obama than Muslim refugees.

More than 40 U.S. states currently have laws that in some capacity restrict non-citizens from being police, but Colorado is not one of them.

In a report issued last October, DOJ blasted citizenship requirements for officers as a “barrier to creating more racially diverse police forces”. It’s absurd isn’t it?

It seems people in Cali finally have had enough, and I agree with them totally! Well. These numbers are well and good, but while 74% of the population supports ending sanctuary cities, only 30% will actually vote out the 90% of the politicians who are mandating the stupid policy. California needs to turn ‘purple’, to give the masses confidence to vote out the politicians who have sold out the citizens and are enriching themselves off the taxpayers. Trump is a good start. I hope soon he’ll cut federal funding to sanctuary cities. It's a damn shame that these days the Golden state is controlled by corrupt Democrats, libtarded nuts and communists. California is an example and warning to the other 49 States of what Not to do!!

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said taking federal funding from the city would be “unconstitutional.” Boston Mayor Marty Walsh called the threat ‘destructive’ and ‘irresponsible’. “If they actually act to take away our money, we’ll see them in court,” claimed NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio.

John Kelly promised to enforce laws against sanctuary cities and said the solution to rising illegal immigration is to deport more people faster, as he laid out a starkly different direction for the Homeland Security Department under a Trump administration. Gen. Kelly, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the sprawling department, said U.S. Border Patrol agents need to be allowed to go after migrants, as he criticized the Obama administration for giving “a pass” to the illegal immigrants caught inside the U.S. and to the cities and counties that shield them. Finally we have a person in charge who actually cares about America and its citizens, instead of corrupt DHS officials bought by Obama's administration. There's a lot of other issues to address. We must make E-Verify a top priority for all federal elections, and before the next wave of illegals get registered to vote in California and other states with automatic motor voter registrations. Current immigration policy is bringing whole country down and only professionals like Kelly are capable to resolve the crisis! The faster deportation are ramped up the better.

There is difference in legal terms, and political correctness should not interfere here. The term ""illegal alien"" or ""illegal immigrant"" had been used to describe those who came to the US without permission and proceeded to establish residence without authorization. Since around 2000, however, many news sources at the behest of immigrant activists changed their terminology to ""undocumented immigrant"" instead. Not only is the new term less accurate than the old one, but it also confuses the reader because the word ""undocumented"" can have a two meanings. It can refer to those who never had proper documentation and those who don't have the required documentation on their person right at that moment. It is kind of like when you are stopped for driving without a license. You may have it at home, just not with you in the car. The term ""illegal"" means that your continued situation is not legal and thus you are an ""outlaw"" in the Old West sense of that word by being outside of the law until you are apprehended and dealt with by the legal system, in this case US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Almost always, illegal immigrants knew they were breaking American law by not going through proper channels to immigrate here legally. Moreover, since they did not come to the US legally, they still retain their citizenship/immigrant status of the country they left, which is properly referred to as ""alien"" status. Therefore, the term ""illegal alien"" is appropriate and more meaningfully descriptive than the politically correct term ""undocumented immigrant"".",https://www.facebook.com/Secured.Borders/posts/904262656341662,GMT-0400
