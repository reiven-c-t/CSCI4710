ISIS has claimed responsibility for the Paris atrocities which killed at least 129 people and French forces struck back with a massive bombardment of the jihadist group's stronghold in Raqqa, Syria. R. Bentley, governor of Alabama, made the declaration following the terrorist atrocities in Paris as it emerged one of the attackers may have posed as a Syrian refugee – referring to a Syrian passport found on the body of one of the suicide bombers. Bentley said: “After full consideration of this weekend's attacks of terror on innocent citizens in Paris, I will oppose any attempt to relocate Syrian refugees to Alabama through the US. As governor, I will not stand complicit to a policy that places the citizens of Alabama in harm's way."" G. Abbott, governor of Texas sent a letter to Obama informing him that the State of Texas will not accept any refugees from Syria in the wake of recent terrorist attacks. Good for you governors! Now wait to see how many more states will also ban the so called ‘refugees’ – more appropriately to call them ILLEGALS.

Traditionally, the speech closes with, “God bless our flag. God bless our troops. God bless America.” In 2005, the Pentagon changed the speech to remove all references to the divine. USAF veteran Oscar Rodriguez was not just asked to leave when he mentioned God – he was actually assaulted and kicked out from the ceremony. Unfortunately, the Pentagon agrees with President’s Administration about erasing Christianity from America. Millions of young Americans rejected God for the last eight years. Losing the faith is the direct way to immorality and sin.

Lee’s birthday is an official state holiday in Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Florida. Other Southern states honor Lee during Confederate Memorial Day (NC, SC, KY, and LA), Lee-Jackson Day (VA), and Decorations Day (TN) during the year. Unfortunately, liberal opinion on the Confederate symbols is based on questionable political expediency, false historical narratives, and increasing ignorance of history. The Confederate symbols don’t represent racism. And Confederate heroes fought for their freedoms, not slavery. For example, Lee believed the institution of slavery was a corrupting scourge to both slaves and slave owners. He has never supported slavery! Winston Churchill once remarked, ""Lee was one of the noblest Americans who ever lived and one of the greatest commanders known to the annals of war."" But Dems blame all Confederate heroes for the fact that the North banned slavery earlier than the South. Wrong political agenda has led to pulling down of the Confederate monuments in American cities. Moreover, denying history seems to be good for those who seek to ruin the United States. But they would like to be anonymous. For example, the donor who is paying to remove four Confederate monuments in New Orleans wants to remain out of the spotlight, giving the money to a private foundation that will in turn write a check to the city. We should not let them to re-write our great history! If authorities are going to pull any monument down, it should be decided by referendum.
